# Tasks

## 1. Install ESLint

ESLint is what is called an static analysis tool. It checks your code for common mistakes that can impact code quality and styling. 

If you haven't already you should install it now.

## 2. Thinking like a Programmer

During these past weeks you have gotten a taste of what programming is: the various concepts, what it looks like in code and the way it's used. However, having written some code doesn't make you a programmer. Thinking like a programmer makes you into a programmer. But what does that mean, 'thinking like a programmer'?

Thinking like a programmer is very similar to thinking like a construction worker:

*  You have to build something and it's up to you to know all the necessary tools and techniques to make that happen, and
*  You have to solve every problem that comes up along the way (such as things that go wrong, knowing how to choose the right tools for the job and striving to achieve the right goal)

The second skill, problem solving, is the most important one. If you get good at that, you'll automatically get good at the first.

Take a look at the following resources to learn more about problem solving as applied to programming:

After you've watched these videos I'd like you to answer these questions

## 1. What do you think the most important quality for a programmer is?

<!-- Write your answer here -->
The most important quality is ability to solve problems

## 2. When trying to solve a challenge, what should you do first?

<!-- Write your answer here -->
The first thing you should do is to understand the challenge then you can have a framework or structure on how you are going to solve the challenge. 

## 3. What should you do if you get stuck?

<!-- Write your answer here -->
1. If you get stuck try to reduce the problem to something simpler.
2. Use the rubber duck technique as this can help you figure out why the error is happening
3. Taking a step back and looking at the problem from a different perspective can help you see things you didn't see initially.
4. Going through your solution step by step is a great way to get unstuck as this will help you find the error is so you can fix it. 
5. Make google your best friend.
